# docker compose to start an RC server

## Quick start

First, you need to make sure you have the `rc`  and `mongo` docker images build and available in your docker registry.

See the `README.md` in each of the `rocketchat` and `mongo` directory on how to build the images.

### start up mongo server

Once you have the images built, make sure you have a `data` directory - then you can startup the mongo server:

```
docker.compose up -d mongo
```

The mongo server will use the `data` directory to store the rocketchat data.   You can take a look in the directory to see that it is populated.

Examine the logs to see that the server is listening to connections:

```
docker logs compose_mongo_1 
```

### initialize mongo replicaset

Next, you need to do this ONE TIME ONLY - to initialize the replicaset in mongo.  This turns the mongo server into a single primary  replicaset node.

```
docker.compose run --rm  mongo-init-replica
```

You should see output similar to:

```
compose_mongo_1 is up-to-date
Creating compose_mongo-init-replica_1 ... done
Attaching to compose_mongo-init-replica_1
mongo-init-replica_1  | MongoDB shell version: 3.2.15
mongo-init-replica_1  | connecting to: mongo/rocketchat
mongo-init-replica_1  | { "ok" : 1 }
compose_mongo-init-replica_1 exited with code 0
```
Note the `{ "ok" : 1 }` responose.

You can also check that the mongo server indeed has started up as a PRIMARY node via the logs:

```
docker logs compose_mongo_1
```

Look for similar message to ones below:

```
2019-02-22T07:54:59.517+0000 I REPL     [ReplicationExecutor] This node is localhost:27017 in the config

2019-02-22T07:54:59.524+0000 I REPL     [ReplicationExecutor] transition to PRIMARY
2019-02-22T07:54:59.531+0000 I NETWORK  [conn1] end connection 172.18.0.3:56380 (0 connections now open)
```
Note that mongo node is now a PRIMARY node. Your mongo server is now up and running as a single node PRIMARY replicaset.

### start the rocketchat server

With the mongo server up and running, you can now start the rocketchat server.  Use the command:

```
docker.compose up -d rocketchat
```

Starting the rocketchat server on a Raspberry Pi or 32 bit ARM SoC board will probably take a minute or two, so please be patient.

Meanwhile, you can check the logs to see the progress:

```
docker logs compose_rocketchat_1
```

Keep checking the logs until you see the `SERVER RUNNING` message box similar to the one below:

```

➔ +----------------------------------------------+
```

Now your Rocket.Chat server is fully up and running on the Raspberry Pi  or 32bit ARMHF SoC server/board!
